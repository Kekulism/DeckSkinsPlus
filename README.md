# DeckSkins+

A mod for Balatro that unlocks the Customize Deck menu's potential, allowing users to create new skins for not just face cards, but ALL cards in the Balatro deck, and implement them in-game with ease.
DeckSkins+ dynamically loads new Custom Deck skins from the /skins/ directory. In theory, you can add as many as you want!

## Creating New Deck Skins

Making an add-on for DeckSkins+ is super easy!
All you need is a small .lua file that contains a table of variables in the /skins/ folder, and 1-2 pairs of textures in the /assets/ folder.
Check the /.example/ folder for more details on how DeckSkins+ add-ons are formatted.

## Installation

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded), without these dependencies this mod will not function.

To install DeckSkins+, download the contents of this repo as a zip file and extract it into your Balatro mods folder. 
Inside the Balatro mods folder, make sure the folder you place the contents of the repo does not end with `-main`! Name the folder something like "DeckSkinsPlus".
